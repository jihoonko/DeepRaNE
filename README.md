# Effective Training Strategies for Deep Learning-based Precipitation Nowcasting and Estimation

In this software, we provided the following implementations in PyTorch:
- Model and Dataset implementation (`model.py` and `dataset.py`): U-Net based model (1x1 resolution) for precipitation nowcasting and estimation, and the dataset for each target task. 
- Codes for experiments: Codes for pre-training and fine-tuning the model, and evaluating the performance of the trained model.
